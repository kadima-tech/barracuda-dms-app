# Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API credentials
# 
# To use the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API, you need to:
# 1. Create a Google Cloud project: https://console.cloud.google.com/
# 2. Enable the Speech-to-Text API: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/speech.googleapis.com
# 3. Create a service account: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
# 4. Download the service account key as JSON
# 5. Set the path to the key file using the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable
# 
# For development, you can set this environment variable in this .env file
# For production, set the environment variable on your server
# 
# IMPORTANT: Never commit your actual service account key to version control!
# Rename this file to .env and add your actual credentials.

# Path to your service account key JSON file
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your-service-account-key.json"

# Or you can use the following to set the credentials directly as JSON (useful for cloud deployments)
# GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id",...}
